# Action-Potential-Ion-Channels
This program demonstrates the behavior of action potential ion channels for potassium and sodium ions. The program uses numpy and matplotlib libraries and first imports the necessary packages. Next, the program sets up time values which are used to calculate values for n, m, and h channels. These values are then used to calculate ion concentrations for potassium and sodium ions. The resulting concentrations are plotted on three separate subplots. The first subplot shows the concentration of potassium ions, the second subplot shows the concentration of sodium ions, and the third subplot displays three lines representing the behavior of n, m, and h channels. The program provides an illustration of ion channels and can be used as a teaching tool or reference for further study.
